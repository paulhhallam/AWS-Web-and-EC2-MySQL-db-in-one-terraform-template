AWS Web and EC2 MySQL db in one terraform template

This is an example of a terraform template to create the network infrastructure and nodes for a 
Public Web server accessing a private EC2 MySQL database.

The main point of this exercise was to prove the template would work before converting the template go use modules.

The cost of this infrastructure is measured in single dollars, especially when almost immediately destroyed.
